# Illini Hyperloop PCB

The shared development environment for the Illini Hyperloop PCB team. Contains all libraries and schematics for the electronics on the pod. 

## Repo layout:
1. Default branch is `pod4`, and pull requests must be made to merge into it
2. `master` branch will only be used for correct, working code. A pull request must be made to merge

## Getting Started

2. Clone this Repo: `git clone https://github.com/IlliniHyperloopComputing/PCB` 
3. Move inside the `PCB` folder that was just created. 
4. Run `git checkout -b *YOUR-NAME* `. This creates a branch for you to work on
