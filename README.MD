# Illini Hyperloop PCB

The shared development environment for the Illini Hyperloop PCB team. Contains all libraries and schematics for the electronics on the pod. 

## Getting Started

[Obtain full student copy of Eagle.](https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/eagle)
Initialize repository in a Eagle folder. 
After you’ve got your git repository up and running you’re going to want to configure eagle. Files included in the library folder aren’t enabled by default. You’re going to have to go through and make sure you select “Use All” for the subfolders provided so the little green dot appears to the right side next to libraries in the Control Panel.
